This website was a five week semester project in the spring of 2023, during the frontend course at Noroff school of technology and digital media, second year first semester: 

## Description
"An auction site is looking to launch a website where users can add items to be bid on and bid on items other users have put up for auction.
When a new user joins the website, they are given 1000 credits to use on the site. They can get credits by selling items and use credit by buying items. Non-registered users can search through the listings, but only registered users can make bids on listings.The assignment was to create a functional online auction website. All API functionality is managed by an existing application. This project only covers the front-end application for the API."
